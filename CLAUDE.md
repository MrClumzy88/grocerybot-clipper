# GroceryBot Clipper — notes for contributors and coding agents

A Chrome MV3 extension that clips digital coupons from the user's own
signed-in browser. README.md covers install, layout and how to add a store.
This is a public project: keep it free of personal data and hard-coded per-user
values (store IDs, account numbers, tokens). Read everything per-user from the
page at run time.

## Ground rules

- Each store (or family of stores sharing a backend) is one adapter in
  `content/<id>.js`, registered with the shared runner (`content/runner.js`).
  Adapters list offers and clip them the way the site does, from the page's own
  JS world, one at a time with jittered pauses.
- When a site answers with a sign-in wall, CAPTCHA or rate limit, the adapter
  stops and tells the user. Don't add workarounds for bot protection: no forged
  or copied tracing headers, no CAPTCHA solving, no fingerprint spoofing.
- Endpoints change. When one breaks, find the current request by reading the
  site's loaded JS bundles or watching the site's own request, not by guessing.
- Chrome throttles timers in background tabs, so the runner's pauses are timed
  by the service worker (`gbc:sleep` → `content/bridge.js` → `background.js`).
- New stores go in `stores.js`, `manifest.json` (host_permissions and
  content_scripts) and the README's store table.

## Store notes (as of 2026-10-31)

- **H-E-B**: list = `/_next/data/<buildId>/en/digital-coupon/coupon-selection/all-coupons.json`
  (cursor pages; `clippedStatus` only when signed in). Clip = plain GraphQL
  `mutation CouponClip { clip(id) }` / `clipGroup(id)` on `/graphql`.
- **Target**: list = redsky `get_circle_noncircle_recommended_promotions_v1`,
  placement `deals_offer_grid_tap`, paged with `page_token`. Save = POST
  `api.target.com/loyalty_guest_offerlists/v1/external/<offerId>?location_id=<store>`.
  PerimeterX returns HTTP 435 + CAPTCHA on bursts.
- **Albertsons family** (`content/albertsons.js`, 15 banners): list = GET
  `/abs/pub/web/j4u/api/ecomgallery?offerPgm=PD-CC-MF-SC&storeId=…`
  (`status` "C"/"U"); clip = POST `/abs/pub/web/j4u/api/offers/clip`. Needs the
  page's shopper token, store id and IBM client id/secret (from `window.AB`,
  `window.SWY`). Coupons page is `/loyalty/coupons-deals`. Akamai blocks bursts.
  Points-redemption rewards aren't in the gallery feed.
- **Kroger family** (`content/kroger.js`, 18 banners): list = GET
  `/atlas/v1/savings-coupons/v2/coupons` (72/page by `page.offset`;
  `addedToCard`, `canBeAddedToCard`, `savings`); clip = POST
  `/atlas/v1/savings-coupons/v1/clip-unclip` `{action:"CLIP", couponId}`.
  Both return 400 `LAF_OBJECTS_REQUIRED` without the store-context headers
  (`x-laf-object`, `x-modality`, `X-Facility-Id`…) the site keeps in memory;
  `content/kroger-context.js` (document_start) records them from the site's own
  /atlas/ requests. Never copy `x-kroger-channel` (the site sets it several
  times; merged values are rejected). Cards hold about 250 coupons (422
  `TooManyCouponsOnCard`), so the adapter clips highest `savings` first.
- **CVS ExtraCare** (`content/cvs.js`): the send-to-card POST carries an
  encrypted account key (`ecKey`), hashed card number, device token and GRID
  tracing header from CVS's own code, so the adapter drives the page:
  `/extracare/home` loads 10 more coupons per scroll to the bottom; cards are
  `.coupon-container-new-ui`, button `button.sc-send-to-card-action` ("Send to
  card"); success = the card says "On card".
- **Walgreens** (`content/walgreens.js`): clip is a plain POST
  `{id, offerStartDate, offerEndDate, source, redemptionType}`, but its URL comes
  from per-account page config, so the adapter drives the page instead:
  `/offers/offers.jsp` loads ~50 more per scroll; buttons
  `button[id^="clip"]` with aria-label "Clip coupon"/"Clip rebate"; success =
  the button disappears. Accounts hold 200 clipped coupons
  (`/offers/v1/svc/coupons/clipped` → `summary.maxClippingLimit`), so the
  adapter clips the largest "$" amount in the card text first.
- **BJ's** (`content/bjs.js`): list = `api.bjs.com/digital/live/api/v1.0/member/available/offers`;
  clip = GET `…/v1.0/store/<club>/coupons/activate?offerId=…` with the site's
  auth, so the adapter drives the page: `/myCoupons` loads 60 more per scroll;
  buttons `button[data-testid="coupon-btn"]` reading "CLIP"; success = the
  button is gone or no longer says CLIP. (fenerty/bjs-coupon-clipper is a
  separate, unlicensed userscript; don't copy from it.)
- **Walmart Cash**: the offer API (persisted `GetAllOffersPageQuery`,
  `clipRewardPromotionEngine`) answers HTTP 429 unless the site's own tracing
  headers are present, so the adapter drives the page instead: cards in
  `[data-testid="all-offer-tiles-container"]`, click
  `[data-testid^="qa-id-walmartReward-"] .pointer`; success = the card says
  "Offer claimed" and stays that way (the UI flips optimistically and reverts
  on failure); pager button `aria-label="Next Page"`, 50 offers per page.
